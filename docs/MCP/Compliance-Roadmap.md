# MCP Compliance Roadmap

This document outlines the optimal sequence for achieving full MCP protocol compliance in the current implementation. The roadmap is designed to address the most critical compliance issues first, with each step building upon the previous ones.

## Phase 1: Full SDK Adoption (Foundation)

**Priority: Critical**
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

The foundation of MCP compliance is consistent use of the official SDK across all components. This eliminates custom implementations that may violate protocol specifications.

1. **Remove Custom JSON-RPC Handling**:
   - Replace all custom JSON-RPC request/response creation with SDK methods
   - Eliminate manual envelope construction and validation
   - Use SDK's `JsonRpc` class for all message handling

2. **Standardize Transport Layer**:
   - Replace direct method calls with proper SDK transport mechanisms
   - Implement SDK-compliant event propagation
   - Use SDK's subscription handling for all resource updates

3. **Refactor Component Initialization**:
   - Update dependency injection to use SDK factory methods
   - Ensure all components are initialized with proper SDK configuration
   - Remove custom initialization logic that bypasses SDK patterns

## Phase 2: Protocol Conformance Validation (Verification)

**Priority: High**
**Timeline: 1 week**

Once the SDK is fully adopted, implement comprehensive validation to ensure all messages and operations conform to the MCP specification.

1. **Implement Message Validation**:
   - Add pre-flight validation for all outgoing messages
   - Validate incoming messages against schema before processing
   - Log and reject non-conformant messages

2. **Add Capability Validation**:
   - Validate server capability declarations against MCP specification
   - Ensure consistent primitive implementation (tools, resources, prompts)
   - Verify capability negotiation follows protocol requirements

3. **Implement Conformance Testing**:
   - Create test suite specifically for protocol conformance
   - Test all message types and flows against specification
   - Automate conformance testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 3: Security Model Implementation (Protection)

**Priority: High**
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

With proper message handling and validation in place, implement the security model to protect against unauthorized access and operations.

1. **Enhance Consent Management**:
   - Implement rigorous consent enforcement across all operations
   - Use SDK consent mechanisms for all permission checks
   - Add consent verification in request processing pipeline

2. **Improve Authentication**:
   - Implement MCP-compliant authentication mechanisms
   - Replace basic authentication with SDK authentication providers
   - Add proper session management with secure token handling

3. **Add Authorization Controls**:
   - Implement fine-grained permission model
   - Add role-based access control
   - Enforce authorization at all access points

## Phase 4: Advanced Protocol Features (Enhancement)

**Priority: Medium**
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

With the core compliance issues addressed, implement advanced protocol features to enhance functionality and interoperability.

1. **Implement Batch Processing**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Add support for batch requests and responses
   - Ensure proper error handling in batch operations
   - Optimize batch processing for performance

2. **Add Progress Reporting**:
   - Implement progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Use SDK progress notification mechanisms
   - Add client-side progress handling

3. **Enhance Resource Handling**: ✅ COMPLETED
    - Implement advanced resource capabilities
    - Add support for resource streaming
    - Implement efficient resource caching
    - Add compression support for reduced bandwidth usage

## Phase 5: Persistence and Scalability (Robustness)

**Priority: Medium**
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

Finally, address persistence and scalability to ensure the implementation can handle production workloads while maintaining compliance.

1. **Implement Persistent Storage**:
   - Add database integration for all state data
   - Ensure persistence doesn't compromise protocol compliance
   - Implement proper state recovery mechanisms

2. **Add Distributed Support**:
   - Enable multi-node deployment
   - Implement distributed consent and context management
   - Ensure protocol compliance across distributed components

3. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize message processing pipeline
   - Add performance monitoring and tuning

## Implementation Guidelines

Throughout all phases, adhere to these guidelines to ensure MCP compliance:

1. **Always Use SDK Methods**:
   - Never implement custom logic for protocol-defined operations
   - Use SDK validation before any message processing
   - Rely on SDK types and interfaces for all MCP-related code

2. **Validate Against Specification**:
   - Regularly check implementation against the MCP specification
   - Use the compliance checklist to verify conformance
   - Consult reference implementations for guidance

3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**:
   - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
   - Follow protocol versioning guidelines
   - Implement graceful degradation for unsupported features

4. **Document Compliance Decisions**:
   - Record rationale for implementation choices
   - Document any deviations from reference implementations
   - Maintain traceability to specification requirements

By following this roadmap, the implementation will achieve full MCP compliance while maintaining a structured, incremental approach that minimizes disruption and ensures quality at each step.
