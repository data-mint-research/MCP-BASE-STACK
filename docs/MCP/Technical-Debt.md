# MCP Host Implementation Technical Debt

This document outlines the technical debt and areas for improvement in the current MCP Host implementation.

## Current Technical Debt

### 1. SDK Integration

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: The current implementation includes fallback mechanisms for when SDK features are not available. These should be removed once the SDK is fully implemented.
- **SDK Feature Assumptions**: The code assumes certain methods and classes exist in the SDK without verification. This could lead to runtime errors if the SDK doesn't match expectations.
- **Incomplete SDK Usage**: Not all components fully utilize the SDK. The client and resource provider implementations still use custom code instead of SDK classes.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **Basic Authentication**: The current implementation uses a simple in-memory authentication system. This should be replaced with a more robust solution for production use.
- **No Password Hashing**: User credentials are not hashed or securely stored.
- **Limited Permission Model**: The permission system is basic and doesn't support role-based access control or fine-grained permissions.

### 3. Persistence

- **In-Memory Storage**: All data (servers, clients, contexts, consents) is stored in memory and lost when the application restarts.
- **No Database Integration**: There's no integration with a database for persistent storage.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are not persisted across application restarts.

### 4. Error Handling

- **Basic Error Responses**: Error responses could be more detailed and follow a standardized format.
- **Limited Validation**: Input validation is minimal and could be enhanced.
- **Exception Handling**: Some exception handling is generic and could be more specific.

### 5. Testing

- **Limited Test Coverage**: The test suite doesn't cover all edge cases and error scenarios.
- **No Integration Tests**: There are no integration tests that verify the interaction between all components.
- **No Performance Tests**: There are no tests to verify performance under load.

### 6. Security

- **Limited Consent Enforcement**: The consent system is implemented but not rigorously enforced across all operations.
- **No Rate Limiting**: There's no protection against abuse through rate limiting.
- **No Input Sanitization**: Input from clients is not thoroughly sanitized.

### 7. Documentation

- **Incomplete API Documentation**: The API endpoints could use more detailed documentation, including request/response examples.
- **Missing SDK Documentation**: There's limited documentation on how to use the SDK with the host component.

## Improvement Plan

### Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)

1. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Standardize error responses
   - Add more detailed validation
   - Improve exception handling

2. **Improve Testing**:
   - Increase test coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Add error scenario tests

3. **Enhance Documentation**:
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add request/response examples
   - Document SDK usage

### Medium-term Improvements (2-4 weeks)

1. **Implement Persistence**:
   - Add database integration
   - Persist servers, clients, contexts, and consents
   - Implement session persistence

2. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Add input sanitization
   - Enforce consent across all operations

3. **Improve SDK Integration**:
   - Remove fallback mechanisms
   - Verify SDK features before use
   - Fully utilize SDK in all components

### Long-term Improvements (1-3 months)

1. **Enhance Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add OAuth or similar authentication
   - Implement fine-grained permissions

2. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add monitoring and metrics
   - Support distributed deployment

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize request routing
   - Implement caching
   - Add performance tests

## Conclusion

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for the MCP Host component, there are several areas that need improvement for a production-ready system. The technical debt identified here should be addressed according to the improvement plan to ensure a robust, secure, and maintainable implementation.
