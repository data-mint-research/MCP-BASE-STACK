## Review Process

### Before Review

1. Run automated checks:
   - Linting (flake8, pylint)
   - Formatting (black, isort)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Tests (pytest)

2. Self-review the code:
   - Check for logical errors
   - Check for edge cases
   - Check for security issues
   - Check for performance issues

### During Review

1. Use this checklist to guide the review
2. Provide constructive feedback
3. Suggest alternatives where appropriate
4. Acknowledge good practices
5. Focus on the code, not the person

### After Review

1. Verify that all issues are addressed
2. Re-run automated checks
3. Update the knowledge graph
4. Document any decisions or trade-offs
5. Approve the changes when satisfied

## Conclusion

This checklist is a guide, not a strict rulebook. Use your judgment and expertise when reviewing code. The goal is to maintain high-quality code that is maintainable, reliable, and efficient.
