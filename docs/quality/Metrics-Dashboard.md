# Quality Metrics Dashboard

The Quality Metrics Dashboard provides a centralized view of quality metrics across the project, trend analysis, and improvement tracking. It integrates with the knowledge graph to provide a single source of truth for quality metrics.

## Overview

The dashboard consists of the following components:

1. **Summary Metrics** - Key quality metrics at a glance
2. **Trend Analysis** - Visualizations of how metrics change over time
3. **Component Metrics** - Detailed metrics for each component
4. **Improvement Tracking** - Track progress towards quality goals

## Running the Dashboard

To run the dashboard, use the following command:

```bash
python scripts/utils/quality/run_quality_dashboard.py
```

By default, the dashboard runs on port 5000. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Command Line Options

The dashboard runner supports the following command line options:

- `--port PORT` - Port to run the dashboard on (default: 5000)
- `--host HOST` - Host to run the dashboard on (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--debug` - Run in debug mode (default: False)

Example:

```bash
python scripts/utils/quality/run_quality_dashboard.py --port 8080 --debug
```

## Dashboard Features

### Summary Metrics

The summary section displays key quality metrics:

- **Documentation Coverage** - Percentage of documented functions and classes
- **Type Hint Coverage** - Percentage of functions with type hints
- **File Structure Compliance** - Compliance with file structure standards
- **Quality Issues** - Number of quality issues detected

### Trend Analysis

The trend analysis section shows how metrics change over time. This helps identify improvements or regressions in code quality.

### Component Metrics

The component metrics section shows detailed metrics for each component in the project. This helps identify which components need the most attention.

### Improvement Tracking

The improvement tracking section shows progress towards quality goals. It compares current metrics with previous metrics and shows the change.

## Integration with Knowledge Graph

The dashboard integrates with the knowledge graph to provide a single source of truth for quality metrics. It reads quality metrics from the knowledge graph and displays them in the dashboard.

When quality checks are run through the dashboard, the results are automatically updated in the knowledge graph.

## Data Sources

The dashboard uses the following data sources:

1. **Knowledge Graph** - Quality metrics stored in the knowledge graph
2. **Quality Reports** - JSON reports generated by quality checks
3. **File Structure Metrics** - Metrics related to file structure compliance
4. **Dependency Audit Reports** - Reports on dependency health

## Refreshing Metrics

To refresh the metrics displayed in the dashboard, click the "Refresh Metrics" button. This will run quality checks and update the knowledge graph with the latest metrics.

## Implementation Details

The dashboard is implemented using:

- **Flask** - Web framework for the backend
- **Chart.js** - JavaScript library for visualizations
- **NetworkX** - Python library for working with the knowledge graph

The dashboard code is located in:

- `core/quality/dashboard.py` - Main dashboard implementation
- `data/dashboard/templates/` - HTML templates
- `data/dashboard/static/` - CSS and JavaScript files
- `scripts/utils/quality/run_quality_dashboard.py` - Script to run the dashboard
