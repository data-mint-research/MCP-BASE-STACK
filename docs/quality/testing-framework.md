# Testing Framework Expansion

This document describes the testing framework expansion for quality modules implemented as part of the enhancement plan (1.4) and the advanced testing capabilities (2.4).

## Overview

The testing framework expansion enhances the testing capabilities for quality modules, ensuring that all components are properly validated, especially with the new modular architecture. The expansion includes dedicated tests for pre-commit hooks, comprehensive Knowledge Graph integration tests, edge case testing for error conditions and recovery, and integration tests for end-to-end workflows.

The advanced testing capabilities further extend the framework with property-based testing, chaos testing, performance benchmarks, comprehensive integration tests, test data generators, and test reporting and visualization.

```bash
pytest -m unit  # Run unit tests
pytest -m integration  # Run integration tests
pytest -m quality  # Run quality tests
pytest -m property  # Run property-based tests
pytest -m chaos  # Run chaos tests
pytest -m performance  # Run performance tests
```

To run tests for a specific module:

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_pre_commit_hooks.py  # Run pre-commit hooks tests
pytest tests/unit/test_kg_integration.py  # Run Knowledge Graph integration tests
