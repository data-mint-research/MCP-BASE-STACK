# Quality Improvement Backlog

## Introduction

This document outlines key quality aspects that need to be addressed in our codebase and development processes. Each aspect represents an area where improvements will enhance code maintainability, reliability, and overall system quality.

## Quality Aspects

### 1. Automated Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Architectural Conformance Checking**: No automated validation that code changes conform to the architectural patterns defined in documentation
- **Dependency Management Validation**: No automated checks for circular dependencies or inappropriate coupling between components
- **Knowledge Graph Consistency Validation**: Missing automated validation between code structure and knowledge graph representation

### 2. Standardization of Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Observability Standards**: No unified approach to metrics collection, distributed tracing, and health checks
- **Resilience Patterns**: Missing standardized circuit breakers, retry policies, and fallback mechanisms
- **Resource Management**: Inconsistent resource acquisition/release patterns across the codebase

### 3. Code Evolution Standards

- **API Versioning Strategy**: No formal specification for API versioning, deprecation, and backward compatibility
- **Feature Flag Framework**: Missing standardized approach to feature flags for controlled rollouts
- **Technical Debt Management**: No systematic approach to identifying, documenting, and addressing technical debt

### 4. Quality Metrics Collection and Reporting

- **Quality Metrics Dashboard**: No centralized dashboard for tracking quality metrics over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Missing automated analysis of quality trends to identify degradation patterns
- **Component-Specific Quality Profiles**: No tailored quality profiles for different component types (e.g., API, data processing, UI)

### 5. Knowledge Transfer and Maintainability

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: No formal process for documenting and communicating architectural decisions
- **Component Interface Documentation**: Inconsistent documentation of component interfaces and contracts
- **Onboarding Documentation**: Missing standardized developer onboarding materials

### 6. Continuous Verification

- **Property-Based Testing**: No standards for property-based testing to identify edge cases
- **Mutation Testing**: Missing mutation testing to validate test effectiveness
- **Performance Regression Testing**: No automated performance regression testing framework
